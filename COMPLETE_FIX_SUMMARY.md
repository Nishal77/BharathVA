# ✅ COMPLETE FIX SUMMARY - All Issues Resolved!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Registration Flow Updated
**Changed flow to match your requirements:**

**OLD Flow:**
1. Email → OTP sent immediately
2. OTP → Details
3. Password → Username

**NEW Flow (as requested):**
1. **Email** → Just saves locally, no API call
2. **Details** (name, phone, DOB) → Saves locally
3. **Submit Details** → **NOW** calls backend, sends OTP to email
4. **OTP** → Verify, then save details to database
5. **Password** → Create & hash
6. **Username** → Complete registration

---

### 2. ✅ Email Template Fixed
**Problem:** Email sending was failing due to formatting error in HTML template

**Error:**
```
FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException: Conversion = b, Flags = #
```

**Cause:** CSS hex colors (#667eea, #FF9933, etc.) conflicted with String.formatted()

**Solution:** Changed from `.formatted()` to `String.format()` with proper escaping (`0%%` instead of `0%`)

**Files Fixed:**
- `backend/auth-service/src/main/java/com/bharathva/auth/service/EmailService.java`
  - `buildOtpEmailTemplate()`
  - `buildWelcomeEmailTemplate()`

---

### 3. ✅ Network Permissions Added
**Problem:** Mobile app couldn't make HTTP requests to local backend

**Solution:** Added network permissions to `app.json`:
```json
{
  "ios": {
    "infoPlist": {
      "NSAllowsArbitraryLoads": true,
      "NSAllowsLocalNetworking": true
    }
  },
  "android": {
    "usesCleartextTraffic": true
  }
}
```

---

### 4. ✅ API Configuration Updated
**Changed:** `BASE_URL: 'http://192.168.0.9:8080/api'`

**Why:** Expo/React Native can't access localhost from simulator

---

### 5. ✅ SMTP Configuration Verified
```
Host: smtp.gmail.com
Port: 587
Username: nishalpoojary@gmail.com
Password: zpgefisdqkerffog (App Password)
TLS: Enabled ✓
```
