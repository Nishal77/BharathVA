# BharathVA Privacy Settings Navigation - FIXED! ✅

## 🔧 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

The problem was that the **wrong profile screen** was being used for navigation. The actual profile screen being rendered was `apps/mobile/app/(user)/[userId]/(tabs)/profile.tsx`, not the one I initially created.

---

## ✅ **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **1. Correct Profile Screen Updated**
- **File**: `apps/mobile/app/(user)/[userId]/(tabs)/profile.tsx`
- **Added**: Privacy settings state and navigation logic
- **Added**: Import for SettingPrivacy component

### **2. Navigation Logic Implemented**
```typescript
// Added state for privacy settings
const [showPrivacySettings, setShowPrivacySettings] = useState(false);

// Added navigation handlers
const handlePrivacyPress = () => {
  setShowPrivacySettings(true);
};

const handleMenuPress = () => {
  handlePrivacyPress();
};

// Added conditional rendering
if (showPrivacySettings) {
  return (
    <SettingPrivacy onBackPress={handleBackPress} />
  );
}
```

### **3. ProfileHeader Integration**
- **Updated**: ProfileHeader to receive privacy navigation props
- **Fixed**: Category menu now properly calls privacy navigation
- **Added**: Proper prop passing for navigation

## 🎯 **NAVIGATION FLOW NOW WORKING**

```
Profile Tab → Tap Category Menu (☰) → Privacy & Security Settings
```

### **Step-by-Step Flow:**
1. **User taps category menu** in ProfileHeader
2. **ProfileHeader calls** `onPrivacyPress` or `onMenuPress`
3. **ProfileTab sets** `showPrivacySettings` to `true`
4. **Component re-renders** and shows SettingPrivacy component
5. **User can navigate back** using the back button
