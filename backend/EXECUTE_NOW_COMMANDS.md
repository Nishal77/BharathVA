## 🚀 RUN THESE COMMANDS (Copy-Paste)

### Step 1: Check Docker Images Built
```bash
cd /Users/nishalpoojary/Projects/Codes/ProjectRD/BharathVA/backend
docker images | grep backend
```

**Expected output:**
```
backend-auth-service        latest    681MB  ✅
backend-gateway-service     latest    576MB  ✅
backend-discovery-service   latest    603MB  ✅
```

---

### Step 2: Start All Services
```bash
docker-compose up
```

**You'll see logs from all services. Wait for:**
```
discovery-service | Started DiscoveryServiceApplication ✅
gateway-service | Started GatewayServiceApplication ✅
auth-service | Started AuthServiceApplication ✅
```

**Keep this terminal running!** Services are now live.

### Step 3: Test in New Terminal

Open **new terminal** (click `+` in Cursor):

```bash
# Check containers
docker ps

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/health

# Register email (TEST THIS!)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"nishalpoojary@gmail.com"}'
```

**📧 CHECK YOUR EMAIL FOR OTP!**
