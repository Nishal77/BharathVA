# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains technical architecture documentation for the BharathVA platform.

## Contents

### System Architecture
[System Architecture](system-architecture.md) - High-level system design, component interactions, and architectural decisions.

**Topics Covered**:
- Overall system architecture
- Service breakdown and responsibilities
- Data flow and communication patterns
- Technology stack details
- Scalability design
- Performance targets

### Database Schema
[Database Schema](database-schema.md) - Complete database design, table structures, and relationships.

**Topics Covered**:
- Table definitions and columns
- Relationships and foreign keys
- Indexes and performance optimization
- Data types and constraints
- Migration management
- Backup and recovery strategies

### Security Architecture
Security architecture and implementation details (to be documented).

**Planned Topics**:
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization model
- Data encryption
- Network security
- API security
- Compliance requirements

## Design Principles

### Microservices Architecture
BharathVA follows microservices architecture with these key principles:

1. **Service Independence**: Each service is independently deployable
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one focused business capability
3. **Decentralized Data**: Each service manages its own database
4. **Communication**: Services communicate via REST APIs
5. **Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and discovery
6. **Resilience**: Services handle failures gracefully

### Scalability Principles

1. **Stateless Services**: All services are stateless for easy horizontal scaling
2. **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization
3. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for performance
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across instances
5. **Auto-Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on metrics

### Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all components
3. **Secure by Default**: Security built into architecture
4. **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
5. **Audit Trail**: All security events logged
